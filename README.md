# Create Block Theme
A WordPress plugin to create block themes.

This tool can create standalone block themes and Blockbase child themes. Find out more about Blockbase at [blockbasetheme.com](https://blockbasetheme.com)

### Step 1 – Setup
Install and activate the [Create Block Theme](https://github.com/Automattic/create-block-theme) plugin. If you want to create Blockbase child themes, you will need to install [Blockbase](https://github.com/Automattic/themes/tree/trunk/blockbase) (or a Blockbase child theme if you want your new theme based on it instead). You will also need to be running the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin.

### Step 2 – Style Customizations
Make changes to your site design using the Customizer and Site Editor.

### Step 3 – Templates
Edit your templates using the Site Editor. For some things you might need to edit the template files again later.

### Step 4 – Export
In the WordPress Admin Dashboard, under Appearance there will be a new page called “Create Block Theme”.

You can add the details for the theme here. These details will be used in the style.css file. When you click the “Create Block Theme” button, a zip file will be downloaded which will contain all the files for your theme.
